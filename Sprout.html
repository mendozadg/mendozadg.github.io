                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                            <p>
                              Plant ownership has been trending, but people have trouble keeping their plants alive. This means they waste money, buying plants that are not conducive to their lighting conditions or climate, and they end up becoming discouraged and giving up. Current resources on plant care are either too basic or geared towards advanced gardeners.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>
                               We designed a mobile add that provides both educational resources and tracking features to help novice plant properly select plants for their location and lifestyle. Our primary differentiator from other competitors is that our app is meant to grow with plant owners as they become more competent, rather than just being a tool to help them get started.
                              </br>
                              The main goals of the project were:

                                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        We started by conducting a competitive evaluation of four direct competitors and 6 indirect competitors. Our goal was to identify similar products inside and outside the gardening space and compare strengths and weaknesses across them. This helped focus our efforts during the user research and inform our overall design process.
                                      </p>

                                    <h3>Generative User Interviews</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        The next step was six in-person generative research interviews to better understand the needs of plant owners. The interviews consisted of 48 questions, divided into four sections: warm-up, general overview, plant type questions, and plant care questions.
                                      </p>

                                        Our key findings from these interviews were the following:
                                        <ul>
                                          <li><i class="ti-arrow-right"></i> Avg. satisfaction level with resources to help with plant selection: 3.42 out of 5</li>

                                        </ul>
                                      </p>

                                    <h3>Survey</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        After gathering qualitative data from the interviews, we designed a survey to gather quantitative data. We pulled the most important questions from the user interviews and turned them into 33 survey questions, and received 53 responses. The biggest takeaways about painpoints are illustrated below:
                                      </p>

                                      <p>
                                        Taking insights from the six interviews we conducted, we made an affinity diagram to better organize key themes and painpoints and compare them with data from the survey.
                                      </p>

                                        The key themes we found were the following:
                                        <ul>
                                          <li><i class="ti-arrow-right"></i> A: While most participants access info about plants online, they are overwhelmed with the amount of info & it’s a lot to sift through.</li>

                                      <h3>Personas</h3>
                                      <p>We created two personas to cover the breadth of users that our app would serve. The goal was for the app to be simple enough for a novice plant owner, like Jordan, to use, yet be comprehensive enough for continued use as a user moved from beginner gardener to advanced, such as Michael. </p>

                                      <h3>Hierarchical Task Inventory</h3>
                                      <p>
                                       After the personas, we created a hierarchical task inventory (HTI) to determine which tasks were most important to users. Plant choice and plant care were frequently brought up as painpoints during interviews, so we focused the HTI on these, listing sub-tasks below to help us visualize the entire process.
                                      </p>

                                      <h3>Journey Map</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        While the HTI was useful, it did not incorporate the emotions of the users so it was difficult to prioritize features. As a solution, we created a user journey map to highlight the biggest painpoints and come up with opportunities to address them in the design stage.

                                  <h1>Design and Evaluation Stage</h1>

                                    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
                                      <p>
                                        For the design stage, we used a diverge and converge tactic, each sketching what we had in mind separately and then comparing. While we were all essentially on the same page, we each depicted slight differences in the information architecture of our designs. Therefore, we created an initial model of the site map to guide the prototype design.
                                      </p>

                                    <h2>Iterative Prototyping</h2>
                                      <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                                      <p>
                                         We began with low-fidelity paper prototypes, so that we felt comfortable scrapping ideas without having spent too much time on the fine details.
                                      </p>
                                      <p><img src="#" alt="alt text"></p>

                                         <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                                           We tested the paper prototypes with five users, per Jacob Nielsen's recommendation. The key findings were the following:
                                      </p>

                                      <h3>Medium-fidelity prototype</h3>
                                      <p>
                                        Using feedback from the paper prototype testing, we moved to medium fidelity so that we could test the true functionality of the design without the distraction of colors or pictures.
                                      </p>
                                      <p><img src="#" alt="alt text"></p>
                                      <p>
                                         <h4>Key Findings</h4>
                                           The bulk of the usability testing of the prototypes was on the medium fidelity version. For this round, we conducted in-person usability tests with nine users, going through the same scenarios from round 1 of testing to better evaluate the improvement of the user experience. Key findings are provided below.
                                      </p>

                                      <h3>High-fidelity prototype</h3>
                                      <p>
                                         Our project ended with a high fidelity prototype. We developed a color scheme of blues and greens to fit the plant theme, while maintaining a simple and clean look to not distract from the pictures of the plants.

                                          <p>
                                            <ul>
                                              <li><i class="ti-arrow-right"></i> Out of 47 survey respondents, only two identified as "Advanced Gardeners." In retrospect, we could have added a question about the possibility of follow-up interviews, since it was tough to recruit advanced users when it came to usability testing.</li>
                                              <li><i class="ti-arrow-right"></i> We tried to include too many features within a short timeline (a semester). In the end, we focused our attention on our key differentiators, which were the photo diagnosing tool and the "choose a plant" wizard and we focused our design scenarios on these features. This resulted in scrapping the collaboritive features of the app. On the plus side, this presents an opportunity for a continuation of this app concept as a personal project.</li>
                                              <li><i class="ti-arrow-right"></i> Lastly, we didn't factor in enough time at the end of the semester to create a final prototype or mockup based on the key findings of the third round of testing. Again, this is another opportunity for a personal project continuation.</li>
